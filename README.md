# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains code snippets and practice problems related to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using Python. I'm currently enrolled in a DSA course on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and using this repo to document my progress. All code files are saved locally and organized topic-wise to make it easy for other learners to follow along.

Whether you're a beginner or revisiting DSA concepts, feel free to explore the code and enhance your understanding!
